Things to do before the stick-variant of ptw is finished:

1) improve the prediction of warped time points - now a clumsy
   interpolation with the danger of NA values. This is also the main
   reason why the stuff does not yet work in easy cases (!): when only
   a single time is available nearly always an NA is returned as the
   new time point. An alternative is to swap the roles of reference
   and sample: instead of warping the time in the sample we can
   warp the time in the reference. This provides an immediate
   prediction of the time for a given set of coefficients, without any NAs.
2) add a plot.stptw function
3) increase efficiency of stick alignment by pre-calculating wac
   values for the reference
